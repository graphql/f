# GraphQL Foundation Social Media Guidelines

## Objectives ##
The objectives of GraphQL Foundation social media:
* Advance topics and conversations that are relevant to and beneficial for the GraphQL community
* Continue building positive affinity for GraphQL related projects among key influencers and throughout the API community
* Drive engagement and participation in GraphQL Foundation projects
* Drive engagement and participation in open questions and conversations about GraphQL's future

## Themes and Topics ##
Informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused content:
* GraphQL Foundation projects
* GraphQL success user stories
* Contributor / SIG blog posts
* Highlight beneficial open source, community projects in the GraphQL ecosystem
* GraphQL in the API Gateway ecosystem
* GraphQL Foundation event information and deadlines (i.e. CFP)
* Technical topics such as security, scale, clients, and architecture
* Informational: Tutorials, editorials, news stories. Items that help connect the dots for our community
* Thought leadership: insights, perspectives, learnings, and experiences 

## Strategy ##
* Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the [values and principles of the GraphQL Foundation](https://github.com/graphql/foundation/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
* Communicate big picture ideas vs “announcements” or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
* Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole
* Maintain a balance of posting on GraphQL Foundation and foundation members activities/news and ecosystem-focused content 
* Share vendor-neutral, community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused
* Engage with the community through retweets and sharing of community content.

## General Guidelines ##

For all GraphQL Foundation social activity, we remain a neutral foundation. Examples of the type of content:
* Owned content is GraphQL Foundation news, blogs, case studies, survey data, etc.
* Project content is anything sourced from [GraphQL Foundation’s currently hosted projects](https://github.com/graphql), including project news, roadmap updates, new releases, performance/security updates, blogs, conferences slides/videos, etc.
* Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, GraphQL-specific Meetups, etc.
  * GraphQL Foundation is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website. 
  * Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared.
  * RTs are limited to news outlet handles, @graphql, project handles + personal handles.
  * Community content that abides by the channel guidelines + includes insight from/work with more than one GraphQL Foundation project will be prioritized for sharing. 
  * Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole. 

## Images & Videos ##
Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”

## Hashtags ##
GraphQL Foundation uses hashtags in our posts:
* To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #GraphQL);
* To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #api)
* To organize or categorize shares (for example, #GraphQL).

## To request content to be shared ##
