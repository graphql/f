# GraphQL / Google Season of Docs 2020

The [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org) is applying for the [2020 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is a fast-growing open source community, supported by a [large number of companies](https://landscape.graphql.org) that use it in production.  While GraphQL has been open source for quite some time, it recently completed its first year as a Linux Foundation project.  You can read more about what we've accomplished in our [2019 annual report](https://foundation.graphql.org/reports/annual-report-2019/).

We are looking for a skilled technical writer who can help with a few projects.  This is a great time to get involved, as we have been working on focusing our efforts, and are planning a documentation redesign.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [#gsod]() channel in the [GraphQL Slack](https://slack.graphql.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about GraphQL.

### 1. Help with the documentation redesign (easy/medium)

**Implement and be a valuable contributor to the redesigned [https://graphql.org](https://graphql.org)**

We’re looking to re-design the GraphQL website, and that is a good time to re-look over all at **the way in which we present the language and documentation**.
You’ll be working with an experienced designer, who can provide reasonably clear briefs (they are a spare time contributor) where you implement the designs into HTML, and then integrate it into the site.
You’d get to join GraphQL working groups to give updates, write about your work on the GraphQL blog and learn skills applicable to working with the web,

**Expected outcomes:** You learn how to create/improve/ship a complex documentation website for a non-trivial language.

**Skills required/preferred:** JavaScript, APIs, HTML/CSS

**Mentor:** Orta Therox, others
